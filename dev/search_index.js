This allows faster indexing and loading times, because the chunking is based on cell id. The cell id encodes the 1D (memory address and cell id) curve to traverse the the 2D surface (geographical coordinates). These space-filling curves are often recursively defined fractals. Solutions for the 2-D plane are the Hilbert and Gosper curve for rectangular and hexagonal grids, respectively. The Superfund grid is a solution for the sphere surface.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = DGGS","category":"page"},{"location":"#DGGS.jl:-A-Discrete-Global-Grid-System-for-Julia","page":"Home","title":"DGGS.jl: A Discrete Global Grid System for Julia","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Documentation for DGGS.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"DGGS.jl is a Julia Package for scalable geospatial analysis using Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), which tessellate the surface of the earth with hierarchical cells of equal area, minimizing distortion and loading time of large geospatial datasets, which is crucial in spatial statistics and building Machine Learning models.","category":"page"},{"location":"#API","page":"Home","title":"API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/#Frequently-Asked-Questions-(FAQ)","page":"FAQ","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"faq/#Reverse-geographical-dimension","page":"FAQ","title":"Reverse geographical dimension","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"faq/","page":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","text":"Sometimes, the latitude can be arranged in ascending or descending order\nDGGS requires to have spatial axes in forward order","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/","page":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","text":"using YAXArrays, NetCDF\npath = download(\"https://s3.bgc-jena.mpg.de:9000/dggs/test/inversed-lat.nc\", \"inversed-lat.nc\")\nc = Cube(path)","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/","page":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","text":"We need to invert the ordwer of the latitude dimensions:","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/","page":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","text":"c = @view c[axes(c, 1), reverse(axes(c, 2)), axes(c, 3)] ","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/","page":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","text":"Transform it into a GeoCube that can be further converted into a CellCube or GridSystem:","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/","page":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","text":"using DGGS\nc = renameaxis!(c, \"longitude\" => :lon)\nc = renameaxis!(c, \"latitude\" => :lat)\ndggs = GeoCube(c)","category":"page"}]
