# The theory behind Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS)

A Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) tessellate the surface of the earth with hierarchical cells of equal area.
This minimizes distortion and loading time of large geospatial datasets, which is crucial in spatial statistics and building Machine Learning models.
